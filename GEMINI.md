## Discussion on `ClearVision-v7-BetterDiscord.theme.css`

We examined the `ClearVision-v7-BetterDiscord.theme.css` file for potential optimizations. It was determined that this file serves as a user-configurable theme file, importing other CSS files and containing comments for readability. The project utilizes a build process (defined in `package.json` scripts like `build-m`) to generate optimized, minified versions of the theme. The user opted not to run the build process at this time.

## Updated `ClearVision-v7-Ruby-Vencord.css`

Modified the `ClearVision-v7-Ruby-Vencord.css` file to change the default channel text color to a grey tone (`#808080`) for improved readability. The `--channel-normal` variable was updated to reflect this change.
